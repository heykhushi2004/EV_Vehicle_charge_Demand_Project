The EV Vehicle Charge Demand Forecasting project leverages machine learning to accurately predict future electric vehicle (EV) charging demand using historical registration data and regional trends. As EV adoption accelerates, ensuring the strategic placement of EV charging infrastructure is critical for reducing congestion and optimizing investment.

This project addresses that need by analyzing historical EV registration data—such as county, model year, and vehicle type—and applying predictive models to estimate future demand. The insights support smarter infrastructure planning and sustainable urban mobility.

With a strong focus on real-world applicability, the project also features a Flask-based web interface that allows dynamic forecasting based on user input. This interactive tool enables planners and stakeholders to generate region-specific demand predictions, making the solution robust, adaptable, and aligned with the goals of sustainable transportation systems.
